AM Client v0.01a
-------------------------
The AM (ASIN Management) Client is designed to allow users to submit product ids from the CC catalog to a centralized ASIN creation system hosted in the main CC building.

How to use:
===============
To launch:
Inside the main folder there is a file named "asin_client.exe". Double click on it in order to start the program. 


Submitting a single product id:

To the submit a product id users must first place the id into the only available text field in the main window. Then they have to click the "Submit" button, which is located in the main window directly below the text field and is conveniently labelled "Submit."
 
Submitting multiple product ids (text field):

To use the text field to submit more than one product id at the same time users must place a comma in between each product id that they wish to submit (e.g. "6349371, 6349373, 6349375") and then click the "Submit" button.

Submitting multiple product ids (CSV):
Click on the button labelled "Submit from .csv file" which is located beneath the "Submit" button in the main window. A director select window will then appear. Select the .csv file that you wish to import, then click "Open."
